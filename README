this is django-kitten.  It allows you to put kittens in your django templates thanks to placekitten.com.

In a template, load the kitten tag as follows:
    {% load kitten %}

The kitten tag will give you the URL for an image of a kitten.  Width and Height dimensions are required.  Typical usage:
    <img src="{% kitten 200x300 %}" />
