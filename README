this is django-kitten.  It allows you to put kittens in your django templates.

Installation Instructions:

add kitten to your list of installed apps.

In a template, load the kitten tag as follows:  `{% load kitten %}`

The `{% kitten 200x300 %}` tag will give you the URL of a 200x300 image of a kitten.  So you probably want to do something like this:
`<img src="{% kitten 200x300 %}" />`
